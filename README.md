# Introduction to Fortran

This is the git repo associated with the training on 
Modern Fortran.

Fist given in 2023 and again with some revisions in January 2026. 
There are a bit more examples in the 2023 edition, which caused 
time issues in 2023. The new edition have cut some examples
(mostly dealing with objects in Fortran). 

Training material is found in both 2023 and 2026 directories. Some 
examples are updated for the 2026 edition. There are more focus on 
actual numerical work in this edition.

The training presentation / slides are also found in the git repo
under 2026 (OpenOffice Present format).


Have fun
