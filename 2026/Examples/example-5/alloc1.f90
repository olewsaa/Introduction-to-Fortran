! We allocate a chunk of memory. Each element is a real of 32 or 64 bits,
! the f2008 std function storage_size(x) return the number of bits used
! by each element of x.
! To get the amount of memory used size(x)*storage_size(x)/8 .       

! GNU fortran support the C function sizeof(x) which report how many bytes
! the argument  occupy in memory. But storage_size(x) is Fortran 2008 standard,
! reporting in bits.
! Be careful with GNU extentions, it might not be portable to other compilers. 

! We allocate space in memory for the vector.      
  allocate(x(vectorsize))

! The random subroutine support vector syntax.  
  call random_number(x)

  write(*,'(10f5.2)') x(1:vectorsize:4) ! Every 4th element.
