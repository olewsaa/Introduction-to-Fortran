# Examples part 3

## Introduction

The concept of vector, matrices, and fields of higher dimension
is one of the key elements of Fortran.

Over the years more and more focus has been on operations on 
such variables. 

## Vector syntax 

This is operations on a multidimensional variable. The examples shows 
multiple examples of how to operate on multidimensional variables. 

This syntax is very versatile and can yield more intuitive program code 
when removing the need for multiple nested do loops.

Note the use of colon. The notation v(:) means all the elements, like
v(1:3) is only the 3 first elements.
